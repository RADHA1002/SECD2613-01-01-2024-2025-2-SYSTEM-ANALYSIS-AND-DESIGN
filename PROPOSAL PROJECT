## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
 
Grab is a popular mobile app used in Southeast Asia that offers many everyday services.
It started as a ride-hailing app (like Uber), but now it’s a super app—meaning it combines many services in one app.
Grab is a leading Southeast Asian super app that offers services like ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payments.
This proposal focuses on enhancing and analyse the existing Grab system of food delivery and grocery and package delivery to address performance inefficiencies and improve the overall user experience.
Through a systematic approach in system analysis and design, the project will identify critical issues and propose viable solutions for optimization. Grab has emerged as a dominant force in the on-demand economy of Southeast Asia. 
Initially launched as a ride-hailing platform, Grab has expanded its services to include transportation, food delivery, financial services, and more.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT  

The current Grab application, while functional, suffers from several issues. 
These include inconsistent response times during peak usage, a complex user interface that confuses new users, and irregular fare pricing that leads to dissatisfaction. 
The system’s feedback and support features are not easily accessible, which hinders timely problem resolution. 
These problems are interrelated as performance and usability directly influence user retention and service efficiency. 

## PROPOSED SOLUTIONS  
 
	Redesign the user interface for clarity and ease-of-use for the customer feedback issues.
	Implement AI-driven features: Personalized suggestions based on time of day, weather, mood (user-set), or dietary preferences. Users discover meals they’re more likely to enjoy and order. 
	Real-time queue & prep time feature: Display how many orders are ahead and estimated prep time. Sets better expectations and reduces cancellations.
