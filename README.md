# SECD2613-01-01-2024-2025-2-SYSTEM-ANALYSIS-AND-DESIGN
The main focus of this course is to provide a practical approach of systems analysis and designing
skills for the students using structured methodology. Hence, the course enables students to study
information system requirements for any system application within an organizational context. The
contents are sequentially organized directly from planning, analysis, designing and implementation
phases. From the resulting output of the planning and analysis phase shall enable students to form
input, output and interface design. Hence a prototype design can be demonstrated.
